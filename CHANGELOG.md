# Changelog

This file tracks the notable changes made to this project. It is meant for humans to read,
and is loosely based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/). The
version numbers generally follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html),
even though I have reservations about what constitutes breaking changes. (What a maintainer
may consider to be a bug might be behavior a consumer relies upon in their project.)

## Unreleased

### Added

- The install generator now detects "app/assets/config/manifest.js" for Sprockets and adds
  the appropriate configuration for Scrapbook's CSS.

### Changed

- Tailwind's generated file now named "tailwind.css" instead of "application.css".

### Removed

- The "app/assets/stylesheets/scrapbook/application.css" file. Scrapbook doesn't currently
  need or use this file as all styles are generated by Tailwind (which also now generates as
  "application.css" instead of "tailwind.css").

### Fixed

- Links in the file browser for secondary scrapbooks now include the name of the scrapbook
  in the path. Before, they wouldn't, and the links would take you to pages that didn't
  exist in the primary scrapbook. (Or, if they did exist, were the ones in the primary one
  and not the one you were looking for.)

- Documentation typos and markup issues

## 0.2.0 (2022-07-18)

Initial release of Scrapbook.

### Added

- Ability to create scrapbook folders. These folders allow for creating a hierarchy of Rails
  template files that can be processed as if they were part of your Rails application.

- A Rails engine that displays the hierarchy and the processed template web views through
  the web interface at the path you mount in your application's routes file.
